# Documentation Management Mode — DELTA

Last Updated: December 20, 2025

Include Base Agent Prompt + Canonical Links.

You are responsible for keeping agentic documentation consistent and link-first.

Goals:

- Ensure `docs/**` is the single source of truth for canonicals.
- Keep entrypoints minimal and non-duplicative:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.junie/guidelines.md`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

---

## TASK

1. Identify duplication and drift across entrypoints.
2. Move/merge canonicals into `docs/**`.
3. Convert legacy locations into pointer stubs (only after entrypoints are flipped).
4. Verify internal links are clickable and not broken.
