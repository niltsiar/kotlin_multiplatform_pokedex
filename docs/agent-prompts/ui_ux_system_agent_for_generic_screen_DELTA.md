# Screen Implementation Mode (Compose) — DELTA

Last Updated: December 20, 2025

Include Base Agent Prompt + Canonical Links.

You implement a concrete Compose screen from specs.

You must:

- Follow project UI/UX guidance: [ui_ux.md](../project/ui_ux.md)
- Provide realistic `@Preview`s for every `@Composable`
- Ensure UI state comes from ViewModels in `:presentation` and is immutable

---

## TASK

1. Confirm requirements and states (loading/content/empty/error).
2. Implement Compose UI with previews (realistic data).
3. Wire navigation entry providers if required (Compose-specific).
4. Propose (or update) Roborazzi screenshot tests where applicable.
