# Conventions for Modular Guidelines

Use this file as a template when adding new topic-specific guideline files under .junie/guides/.

- Scope a file to one topic (e.g., navigation, state management, persistence).
- Keep guidance platform-agnostic unless the topic is platform-specific; if so, add sub-sections for Android/iOS.
- Prefer imperative, actionable bullets over prose.
- Link back to primary docs when behavior is product-driven: project/prd.md, project/user_flow.md, project/onboarding.md.
- Include: purpose, location (where code lives), interfaces/boundaries, error handling, testing, and alignment with product docs.

Naming: use lowercase with underscores, e.g., feature_toggles.md, cache_strategy.md.
